    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/001.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Hello, and welcome to the fourth episode of the Software Carpentry lecture on regular expressions.  In this episode, we'll have a look at a few more patterns you can use to build up regular expressions.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/002.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you recall, we're trying to parse data from notebooks recording background evil levels in millivaders at several sites in the Shire a couple of years after the explosion of the Death Star.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/003.png" />
    <p class="media-body">These records are in different formats, and a couple of episodes ago&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/004.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;we managed to build this function to extract the dates from those records.  Inside this function, we're applying a regular expression to the record.  If it matches, we're returning the matched groups, reordering them as necessary so that we always get back year, month, and day.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/005.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This version of the function does a better job of pulling data out of our records.  First, it gets the site and reading, as well as the year, month, and day.  Second, and more importantly, this function is more declarative: the variable <code>patterns</code> stores one entry for each format of record we think we have to parse.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/006.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The first element of each entry is a regular expression to match data in that format.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/007.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The remaining fields in the entry are a permutation of the indices of the groups in that pattern.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/008.png" />
    <p class="media-body">In our loop, we pull the pattern and the indices for the year, month, day, site, and reading out of each entry in the table in turn.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/009.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If the pattern matches&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/010.png" />
    <p class="media-body">we then return the matched groups, permuting them according to the indices so that the data always comes back in the same order: year, month, day, site, and reading.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/011.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Why is this better?  Well, every time we have another data format to match, all we have to do is add one more entry.  This makes this function very easy to extend, and very easy to test.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/012.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So let's take a look at Notebook #3.  It has the date as three fields, the site name in parentheses, and then the reading.  We know how to parse dates in this format&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/013.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and the fields are separated by spaces&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/014.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;but how do we match against those parentheses?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/015.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So far, when we've seen parentheses in regular expressions, they haven't matched characters: they've created groups.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/016.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The way we solve this problem&mdash;i.e., the way we match a literal open parenthesis '(' or close parenthesis ')' using a regular expression&mdash;is to put backslash-open parenthesis '\(' or backslash-close parenthesis '\)' in the RE.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/017.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This is another example of an <em>escape sequence</em>.  Just as we use the two-character sequence '\t' in a string to represent a literal tab character, we use the two-character sequence '\(' or '\)' in a regular expression to match the literal character '(' or ')'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/018.png" />
    <p class="media-body">However, in order to get that backslash '\' into the string, we have to escape it by doubling it up.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/019.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So the string representation of the regular expression that matches an opening parenthesis is actually '\\('.  This might be confusing, so let's take a look at how the various layers work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/020.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Our program text&mdash;i.e., what's stored in our <code>.py</code> file&mdash;looks like this.  Here, we have two backslashes, an open parenthesis, two backslashes, and a close parenthesis inside quotes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/021.png" />
    <p class="media-body">When Python reads that file in, it turns the two-character sequence '\\' into a single literal '\' character in the string in memory.  That's the first level of escaping.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/022.png" />
    <p class="media-body">When we hand the string '\(\)' to the regular expression library, it takes the two-character sequence '\(' and turns it into an arc in the finite state machine that matches a literal parenthesis.  Turning this over, if we want a literal parenthesis to be matched, we have to give the regular expression library '\('.  If we want to put '\(' in a string, we have to write it in our <code>.py</code> file as '\\('.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/023.png" />
    <p class="media-body">With that out of the way, let's go back to Notebook #3.  The regular expression that will extract the five fields from each record&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/024.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;looks like this: <code>'([A-Z][a-z]+) ([0-9]{1,2}) ([0-9]{4}) \\((.+)\\) (.+)'</code> A word beginning with an upper-case character followed by one or more lower-case characters, a space, one or two digits, another space, four digits, another space, some stuff involving backslashes and parentheses, another space, and then one or more characters, which is the reading.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/025.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If we take a closer look at that "stuff", '\\(' and '\\)' are how we write the regular expressions that match a literal open parenthesis '(' or close parenthesis ')' character in our data.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/026.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The two inner parentheses that don't have backslashes in front of them create a group, but don't match any literal characters.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/027.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We create that group so that we can save the results of the match&mdash;in this case, the name of the site.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/028.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Now that we know how to work with backslahes in regular expressions, we can take a look at character sets that come up frequently enough to deserve their own abbreviations.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/029.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you use '\d' in a regular expression, it matches the digits 0 through 9.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/030.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you use '\s', it matches the whitespace characters (space, tab, carriage return, and newline).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/031.png" />
    <p class="media-body">And '\w' matches word characters: it's equivalent to the set shown on the right of upper-case letters, lower-case letters, digits, and the underscore <code>'[A-Za-z0-9_]'</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/032.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This might seem a funny definition of "word"; it's actually the set of characters that can appear in a variable name in a programming language like C or Python.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/033.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Again, in order to write one of these regular expressions as a string in Python, you have to double up the backslashes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/034.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Now that we've seen these character sets, we can take a look at an example of really bad design.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/035.png" />
    <p class="media-body">'\S' means "non-space characters", i.e., everything that isn't a space, tab, carriage return, or newline.  That might seem to contradict what I said a few seconds ago&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/036.png" />
    <p class="media-body">but that's an upper-case 'S', not a lower-case 's'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/037.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Similarly, and unfortunately, '\W' means "non-word characters"&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/038.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;provided it's an upper-case 'W'.  Upper- and lower-case 'S' and 'W' look very similar, particularly when there aren't other characters right next to them to give context.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/039.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This means that these sequences are very easy to mis-type&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/040.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and what's worse, even easier to mis-read.  Everyone eventually uses an upper-case 'S' when they meant to use a lower-case 's', or vice versa, and then wastes a few hours trying to track it down.  So please, if you're ever designing a library that's likely to be widely used, try to choose a notation that doesn't make mistakes this easy.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/041.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Along with the abbreviations for character sets, the regular expression library recognizes a few shortcuts that match things that aren't actual characters.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/042.png" />
    <p class="media-body">For example, if you put a circumflex '^' at the start of a pattern, it matches the beginning of the input text.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/043.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So the pattern <code>'^mask'</code> will match the text <code>'mask size'</code> because the letters 'mask' come at the start of the string.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/044.png" />
    <p class="media-body">But that same pattern will <em>not</em> match the word <code>'unmask'</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/045.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Going to the other end, if dollar sign '$' is the last character in the pattern, it matches the end of the input text rather than a literal '$'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/046.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So 'temp$' will match the string 'high-temp'&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/047.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;but it won't match the string 'temperature'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/048.png" />
    <p class="media-body">A third shortcut that's often useful is '\b', often called "break".  It matches the boundary between word and non-word characters: it doesn't actually match any characters&mdash;it doesn't consume any input&mdash;but it matches the transition between non-word characters and letters, digits, and the underscore.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/049.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If we have <code>'\\bage\\b'</code>, it will match the string <code>'the age of'</code>, because there's a non-word character right before the 'a', and another non-word character right after the 'e'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/050.png" />
    <p class="media-body">That same pattern will not match the word <code>'phage'</code> because there isn't a transition from non-word to word characters, or vice versa, right before the 'a'.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="patterns/051.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We've now seen about a dozen of the atoms that are used to build regular expressions.  There are many more, and every language or library adds a few of its own.  In the next episode, we'll take a closer look at the functions in the regular expression library that are used to apply these to problems.</p>
