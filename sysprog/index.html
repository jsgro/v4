<div class="overview">
  <p>
    Once programmers start to manipulate files and directories in more sophisticated ways,
    there comes a point when it makes sense to stop using shell scripts
    and start doing it with programming languages that have
    more sophisticated control constructs and data structures.

  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li>Programs can open and read directories to find out what files those directories contain.</li>
    <li>They can work recursively on the contents of nested directories by walking the directory tree.</li>
