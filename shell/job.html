<ul class="keypoints">
  <li>The command ps can be used to list processes, called jobs, that are running.</li>
  <li>Appending a &amp; to the end of a command makes that command run in the background.</li>

    <p class="media-body">Hello, and welcome to the seventh episode of a longer-than-expected Software Carpentry lecture on the Unix shell.  This episode will take a quick look at job control, a topic that's less important today than it was back in the Dark Ages, but which is coming back into its own as more people begin to leverage the power of computer networks.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/002.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We're looking at how to control a computer using a command-line shell.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/003.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We've seen how to use pipes to combine programs&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/004.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;which tells the shell to use the output of one as the input of the next.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/005.png" />
    <p class="media-body">What we'll look at in this episode is how to control programs <em>once they're running</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/006.png" />
    <p class="media-body">What we really mean by that is how to control <em>processes</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/007.png" />
    <p class="media-body">A process is just a running program.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/008.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Some of the processes on your computer are yours: they're running programs you explicitly asked for, like your web browser.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/009.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Many others belong to the operating system that manages your computer for you, or, if you're on a shared machine, to other users.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/010.png" />
    <p class="media-body">You can use the <code>ps</code> command to list them, just as you use <code>ls</code> to list files and directories.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/011.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's some typical <code>ps</code> output.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/012.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Every process has a unique process id.  Remember, this is a property of the process, not of the program that process is executing: if you are running three instances of your browser at once, each will have its own process ID.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/013.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The second column in this listing shows the ID of each process's parent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/014.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Every process on a computer is spawned by another, which is its parent&mdash;except, of course, for the boot process that runs automatically when the computer starts up.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/015.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The third column is the ID of the <em>process group</em> this process belongs to.  We won't discuss process groups in this lecture, but they're often used to manage sets of related processes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/016.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Column 4 shows the ID of the terminal this process is running in.  Once upon a time, this really would have been a terminal connected to a central timeshared computer.  It isn't as important these days&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/017.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;except that if a process is a system service, such as a network monitor, <code>ps</code> will display a question mark for its terminal, since it doesn't actually have one.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/018.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Column 5 is more interesting: it's the user ID of the user this process is being run by.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/019.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This is the user ID the computer uses when checking permissions: the process is allowed to access exactly the same things as the user, no more, no less.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/020.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Finally, Column 6 shows when the process started running&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/021.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and Column 7 shows what program the process is executing.  Your version of <code>ps</code> may show more or fewer columns, or may show them in a different order, but the same information is generally available everywhere.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/022.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The shell provides several commands for stopping, pausing, and resuming processes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/023.png" />
    <p class="media-body">To see them in action, let's run our <code>analyze</code> program on our latest data files.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/024.png" />
    <p class="media-body">After a few minutes go by, we realize that this is going to take a while to finish.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/025.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Being impatient, we kill the process by typing Control-C.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/026.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This stops the currently-executing program right away; any results it had calculated, but not written to disk, are lost.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/027.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Let's run that same command again&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/028.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;with an ampersand <code>&amp;</code> at the end of the line to tell the shell we want it to run in the <em>background</em>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/029.png" />
    <p class="media-body">When we do this, the shell launches the program as before.  Instead of leaving our keyboard and screen connected to the program's standard input and output, though, the shell hangs onto them.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/030.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This means the shell can give us a fresh command prompt, and start running other commands, right away.  Here, for example, we're checking for new Facebook events.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/031.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Since there's nothing going on, let's run the <code>jobs</code> command.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/032.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This tells us what processes are currently running in the background.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/033.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Since we can't think of any other way to procrastinate, we can use the foreground command, <code>fg</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/034.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This brings our background job into the foreground.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/035.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If we have several jobs running in the background, we can control which one we bring to the foreground using <code>fg %1</code>, <code>fg %2</code>, and so on.  The IDs are <em>not</em> the process IDs; instead, they are the job IDs displayed by the <code>jobs</code> command.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/036.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Finally, when <code>analyze</code> finishes running, the shell gives us a fresh prompt as usual.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/037.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The shell gives us one more tool for job control: if a process is already running in the foreground, Control-Z will pause it and return control to the shell.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/038.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We can then use <code>fg</code> to resume it in the foreground&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/039.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;or <code>bg</code> to resume it as a background job.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/040.png" />
    <p class="media-body">For example, let's run <code>analyze</code> again&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/041.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and then type Control-Z.  The shell immediately tells us that our program has been stopped, and gives us its job number.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/042.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If we type <code>bg %1</code>, the shell starts the process running again, but in the background.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/043.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We can check that it's running using <code>jobs</code>&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/044.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and if we want, kill it while it's still in the background using <code>kill</code> and the job number.  This has the same effect as bringing it to the foreground and then typing Control-C.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/045.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Job control was important when users only had one terminal window at a time.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/046.png" />
    <p class="media-body">It's less important now: if we want to run another program, it's easy enough to open another window and run it there.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/047.png" />
    <p class="media-body">However, these ideas and tools are making a comeback, as they're often the easiest way to run and control programs on remote computers elsewhere on the network.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="job/048.png" />
    <p class="media-body">A future episode will take a look at how we can do that securely.  First, though, we need to look at shell variables.</p>
