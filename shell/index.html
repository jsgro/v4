<div class="overview">
  <p>
    The Unix shell is older than most of the people who use it.
    It has survived so long because it is
    one of the most productive programming environments ever created&mdash;maybe even
    <em>the</em> most productive.
    Its syntax may be cryptic,
    but people who have mastered it can experiment with different commands interactively,
    then use what they have learned to automate their work.

<div class="keypoints">
  <ul>
    <li>The shell is an interactive interpreter: it reads commands, finds the corresponding programs, runs them, and displays output.</li>
    <li>Output can be redirected using &gt; and &lt;.</li>
    <li>Commands can be combined using pipelines.</li>
    <li>The <code>history</code> command can be used to view and repeat previous operations, while tab completion can be used to save re-typing.</li>
    <li>Directories (or folders) are nested to organize information hierarchically.</li>
    <li>Use <code>grep</code> to find things in files, and <code>find</code> to find files themselves.</li>
    <li>Programs can be paused, run in the background, or run on remote machines.</li>
    <li>The shell has variables like any other program, and these can be used to control how it behaves.</li>
  </ul>
