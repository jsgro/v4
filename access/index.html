<div class="overview">
  <p>
    A database is the right tool for structuring and managing many kinds of complex data.
    Thousands of programmer-years have gone into their design and implementation
    so that they can handle very large datasets&mdash;terabytes or more&mdash;quickly and reliably.
    Queries allow for great flexibility in how you are able to analyze your data,
    which makes databases a good choice when you are exploring data.

  <ul>
    <li>Use a database to store and manage regular data (and make your data regular so that it can be managed).</li>
    <li>Use queries to express <em>what</em> you want, and let the computer figure out <em>how</em> to get it.</li>
    <li>Remember to account for gaps in your data.</li>
  </ul>
