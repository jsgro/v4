<div class="overview">
  <p>
    Correlation does not imply causality,
    but there is a very strong correlation between
    using version control
    and doing good computational science.
    (There's an even stronger correlation
    between <em>not</em> using it and wasting effort.)
    Good record keeping is essential to good science;
    without the kind of record-keeping that version control provides,
    there's no way to know exactly who did what, when.

  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li>Version control is a reliable way to share files between machines.</li>
    <li>It also allows people to work simultaneously by tracking and managing conflicts.</li>
    <li>And keeps a permanent history of what state programs, data, and documents were in at various times.</li>
  </ul>
