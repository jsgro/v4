  <p>
    Numbers are easy to represent as text,
    but much of the data scientists now work with is more naturally stored as images, audio, or video.
    All of these formats have more internal structure than plain text,
    and are associated with specialized operations and algorithms for manipulating them.

  <ul>
    <li>Images may be stored in many different formats, but are normally represented in memory as rectangular patches of pixels.</li>
    <li>Media formats are either lossy or lossless.</li>
