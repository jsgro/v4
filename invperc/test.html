    <p class="media-body">Hello, and welcome to the next episode of the Software Carpentry lecture on program design using invasion percolation as an example.  In this episode, we'll take a closer look at how we test our invasion percolation program.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/002.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If you recall, in an earlier episode we found one bug&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/003.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;which makes us wonder, how many others are still lurking in our code?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/004.png" />
    <p class="media-body">More generally, how do we validate and verify a program like this?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/005.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Verification is the question, "Is our program free of bugs?" I.e., have we built it the right way?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/006.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Validation is the question, "Have we built the right program?" I.e., are we using a good model?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/007.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The second is a question for the scientists&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/008.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;so we'll concentrate on the first.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/009.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This is the first test case that we want to try.  The grid shown on the left has 2's everywhere&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/010.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;except for three 1's that run in a straight line from the middle directly to the edge.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/011.png" />
    <p class="media-body">It should fill in as shown here.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/012.png" />
    <p class="media-body">And if it doesn't, it should be pretty easy for us to figure out what's gone wrong.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/013.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We restructured our program as shown here in order to make it easier to construct and run test cases.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/014.png" />
    <p class="media-body">If we take a closer look at the main body of the program, the first command-line argument specifies the scenario.  If the name of the scenario is "random", then we get parameters, create a grid, fill it with random values, fill that grid to the edge, and report.  Otherwise, we just say that we don't know what the scenario is.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/015.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Let's add another clause, so that if the scenario is "5&times;5 line", we will create a 5&times;5 grid, fill a line of cells from the center to the edge with lower values, and then check that <code>fill_grid</code> does the right thing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/016.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Let's expand that English description into a few lines of code.  We want to create a 5&times;5 grid, initialize it with the values shown earlier (i.e., 2's everywhere except for 1's from the center to the edge), call the <code>fill_grid</code> function that we're testing, and then check that we get the right result.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/017.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The grid creation and <code>fill_grid</code> functions already exist&mdash;they're part of our regular program.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/018.png" />
    <p class="media-body">So we need write functions to initialize the 5&times;5 grid with the values that we need to test, and then check after filling that it has been filled correctly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/019.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We're going to have to write a similar pair of functions for each of our tests.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/020.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We'll write the first pair, and then use that experience to guide us when we refactor to make it easier to add more tests later.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/021.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's the function that initializes a grid of N&times;N cells with a line running from the center to the edge.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/022.png" />
    <p class="media-body">It's just as easy to write this function for the N&times;N case as for the 5&times;5 case, so we generalize early.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/023.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This part of the function is easy to understand.  We find the value of N by looking at the grid, and then fill all of the cells with the integer 2.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/024.png" />
    <p class="media-body">This part, that fills the cells from the center to the edge in a straight line with the lower value 1, isn't as easy to understand.  It's not immediately obvious that <code>i</code> should go in the range from 0 to N/2+1, and it's not immediately obvious either that the X coordinate should be N/2 and the Y coordinate should be <code>i</code> for the cells that we want to fill.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/025.png" />
    <p class="media-body">When we say "it's not obvious," what we mean is, "There's the possibility that it will contain bugs."  If there are bugs in our test cases, then we're just making more work for ourselves.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/026.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We'll refactor this code later so that it's easier for us to see that it's doing the right thing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/027.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's the code that checks that an N&times;N grid with a line of cells from the center to the edge has been filled correctly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/028.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Again, it's as easy to check for the N&times;N case as the 5&times;5 case, so we've generalized the function.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/029.png" />
    <p class="media-body">But take a look at this condition.  Are we sure that the only cells that should be filled are the ones with X coordinate equal to N/2 and Y coordinate from 0 to N/2? Shouldn't that be N/2+1?  Or maybe it's 1 to N/2.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/030.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Or maybe the X coordinate should be N/2+1.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/031.png" />
    <p class="media-body">In fact, these two functions <em>are</em> correct&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/032.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and when they're run, they report that <code>fill_grid</code> behaves properly.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/033.png" />
    <p class="media-body">But writing and checking two functions like this for each test won't actually increase our confidence in our program&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/034.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;because the tests themselves might contain bugs.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/035.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We need a simpler way to create and check tests, so that our testing is actually helping us create a correct program rather than giving us more things to worry about.  How do we do that?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/036.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Well, let's go back to our example.  The grid on the left should fill in as shown on the right.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/037.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Why don't we just draw our test cases exactly as shown? The reason is that modern programming languages, including Python, don't actually let you draw things.  But we can get close with a little bit of work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/038.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here are the values that we want to put in our test grid: 2's everywhere, except for 1's from the center to the edge.  We've represented it as a multiline string, which is easy to read&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/039.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and also easy to write&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/040.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;which means it'll be easy for us to create lots of other test cases.  We won't have to write code: we can just write strings.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/041.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The word "fixture" is the technical term for "the thing that the test is run on".  It's the thing you set up in order to check whether a piece of code is working.  We'll see this term a lot more in future lectures.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/042.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's the result that we expect when we fill in this grid.  Again, it's a multiline string, so it's easy to write, and easy to read.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/043.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The '*' character means "this cell should be filled".</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/044.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The '.' character means "this cell should hold whatever value it had at the start", i.e., it shouldn't have changed.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/045.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Here's how we would actually use these two strings in test code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/046.png" />
    <p class="media-body">First, we're going to put the strings holding our fixtures and the expected results in a list of pairs.  We can then loop over this list to check each fixture and result in turn.  Again, this makes it very easy to add more tests: we just define two multiline strings, and then add one more pair to this list called <code>TESTS</code>.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/047.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We write a function called <code>run_tests</code>, and as the doc string says, it runs all of our tests at once.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/048.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Inside the loop, we get <code>fixture</code> and <code>result</code>&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/049.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;we use the values in <code>fixture</code> to initialize a grid by breaking that multiline string into pieces and converting those pieces into integers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/050.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We then call the <code>fill_grid</code> function that we actually want to test&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/051.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and then we take the actual result, which is in <code>grid</code>, the number of cells that were filled, the initial fixture, and the expected result, and we pass it into a function that checks to make sure everything is right.  We only have to write <code>create_fixture_grid</code> and <code>check_result_grid</code> once.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/052.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Doing that is left as an exercise for the viewer.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/053.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Describing the fixtures and the results as strings is easy, but writing those two new functions might seem like a lot of work.  The question is, when you say it's a lot of work&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/054.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;what are you comparing it to?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/055.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Are you comparing it to the time it would take to inspect printouts of real grids, or step through the program over and over again in the debugger?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/056.png" />
    <p class="media-body">And did you think to include the time it would take to re-do this after every change to your program?</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/057.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Or are you comparing it to the time it would take to retract a published paper after you find a bug in your code? Because that's what we're trying to prevent.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/058.png" />
    <p class="media-body">In real applications, it's not unusual for test code to be anywhere from 20% to 200% of the size of the actual application code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/059.png" />
    <p class="media-body">And yes, 200% does mean more test code than application code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/060.png" />
    <p class="media-body">But that's no different from physical experiments.  If you look at the size and cost of the machines used to create a space probe, it's many times greater than the size and cost of the space probe itself.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/061.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The good news is that there are frameworks to help you do this&hellip;</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/062.png" />
    <p class="media-body">&hellip;and we will look at those in future lectures.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/063.png" />
    <p class="media-body">The other good news is, once your tests have been written, changing the program itself becomes much easier. In particular, we're now in a position to replace our <code>fill_grid</code> function with one that is harder to get right, but which will run many times faster.  If our tests have been designed well, they shouldn't have to be rewritten because they'll all continue to work the same way.  This is a common pattern in scientific programming. You create a simple version first, check it, and then replace the parts one by one with more sophisticated parts that are harder to check, but give you better performance.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/064.png" />
    <p class="media-body">We'll take a look at how to do this in the next episode.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="media">
    <img class="media-object pull-left" src="test/065.png" />
    <p class="media-body">Thank you.</p>
