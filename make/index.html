<div class="overview">
  <p>
    Originally invented to manage compilation of programs written in languages like C,
    Make can be used to automatically update any set of files
    that depend on another set of files.
    This makes it a good solution for many data analysis and data management problems.

    <li>A Makefile describes how files depend on each other, and how to update out-of-date files.</li>
    <li>Use patterns, rules, and variables to eliminate redundancy.</li>
    <li>Use macros to control operation.</li>
